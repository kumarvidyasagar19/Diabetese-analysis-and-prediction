# Data analysis of diabetes dataset and prediction with several machine learning algorithms to choose which is best.

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for
## 1. Data preprocessing






 - Missing and null values handling
 - Correlation testing
 - Feature extraction

## 2. Classify the patients in different age group suffering with diabetic :
  Creating new dataset of three age group
  - Young age group (0 to 35) years
  - Middle age group (36 to 55) years
  - Old age group (56 or more) years

  To visualise histogram which age group are more affected of diabetes: 
  - Creating all age groups new dataset only for diabetic patients.
  - plotting seprate histogram of all three age groups.
  - analyse all age group seprately which age person are more diabetes patients. 

  
## 3. Prepare the visualization of data and interpretation.
  - visualise histogram of all features of Top 10.
## 4. Compute meaningful statistical parameters.
  - find mean, median, mode, standard deviation, min and max
## 5. Find the significant health index of diabetic patients.

## 6. Develop a suitable model of diabetic patients.
I have used 4 model to test which model giving maximum score on testing data.
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-nearest neighbour (KNN)
  - Artficial neural network (ANN)
